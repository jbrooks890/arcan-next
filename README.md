# Arcan (Front End)

## What is _Arcan_?

_Arcan_ is a Fantasy/Science-Fiction series by Julian Brooks. The story follows its main character, _Kyran Unikade_, through the tribulations and triumphs of his journey to rid himself of the terrible curse that has befallen him, the _Godfall_.

### Who is _Arcan_?

Not ‘who’. Arcans were the first mortal species ever to walk the face of Terra and became extinct after an epochal and cataclysmic event. Kyran, by some otherworldly phenomenon, is an Arcan of the modern day, where his primordial species is unrecognizable to the average pedestrian yet regarded with scathing rhetoric.

### When and where is Arcan set?

_Arcan_ is set in the distant future of an alternate universe on the verge of divine annihilation. A terrible poison plagues the planet, an ominous echo seldom rings through the sky and black rain riddles the land.
There is some overlap with the real world for the sake of familiarity, but mostly features original creatures and technology.

## The Arcan Project

_The Arcan Project_ is an endeavor to deliver the series’ plethora of lore to the world. The concept is akin to a digital museum or theme park where members are granted access to various outlets that help describe the world of Arcan in its entirety.
It operates similar to a video game, paying homage to a time before paywalls and downloadable content by allowing users to unlock content progressively by exploring the various corners of the website.
The Arcan Project is also an opportunity to revisit the original novel released in 2016. In many ways, **_Arcan: The Missing Nexus_** was a success, providing valuable feedback [and other things]

### MVP

The Project has an ambitious litany of features on the docket, but only two of which are the most fundamental. The first and foremost is book availability, giving members the option to read each novel for free. The second feature is the character database, providing profiles of the various characters and their illustrations.

### Goal

The goal is to introduce Arcan to as much of the world as reasonably possible and to do it by expanding its small core platform. The mission is to form a community behind the franchise.

### Beyond MVP

Beyond the Project’s minimum viable product is a suite of other exciting features, to include the features listed below:

- Wiki/glossary of lore (magic, creatures, organizations, etc.)
- Navigable maps
- Language decoding
- Puzzles and quizzes
- Events and challenges

Some content is being developed concurrently with the MVP but may be released at a later time. By becoming a subscriber you’ll receive updates of when new features are released in addition to other Arcan-centric info.
