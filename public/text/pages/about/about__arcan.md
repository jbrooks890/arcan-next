## What is _Arcan_?

_Arcan_ is a Fantasy/Science-Fiction series by Julian Brooks. The story follows its main character, _Kyran Unikade_, through the tribulations and triumphs of his journey to rid himself of the terrible curse that has befallen him, the _Godfall_.

### Who is _Arcan_?

Not ‘who’. Arcans were the first mortal species ever to walk the face of Terra and became extinct after an epochal and cataclysmic event. Kyran, by some otherworldly phenomenon, is an Arcan of the modern day, where his primordial species is unrecognizable to the average pedestrian yet regarded with scathing rhetoric.

### When and where is Arcan set?

_Arcan_ is set in the distant future of an alternate universe on the verge of divine annihilation. A terrible poison plagues the planet, an ominous echo seldom rings through the sky and black rain riddles the land.
There is some overlap with the real world for the sake of familiarity, but mostly features original creatures and technology.
